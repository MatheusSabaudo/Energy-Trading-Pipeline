CALCULATE HOURLY PRODUCTION FROM THE PANELS:

- CLOUD FACTOR:
	We calculate a cloud factor between 0 and 1 to account for cloud cover.
	1 → ideal conditions (clear sky, full sun)
	0 → very cloudy (almost no sunlight reaching the panels)
	This factor scales the solar potential linearly based on cloudiness.


- TEMPERATURE:
	Solar panel efficiency decreases at high temperatures.
	We use a temperature loss coefficient (temp_loss_coeff) to model this effect.
	If the outside temperature is above 25°C (Standard Test Conditions), the efficiency drops linearly according to the coefficient.
	Below 25°C, no efficiency loss is applied.

- UV FACTOR: 
	Higher solar irradiance -> More potential solar output



CALCULATE DAILY PRUDUCTION:

	We calculated the daily production by summing the hourly kWh values for each day in the DataFrame.
	For each date, all hourly production values were added together to get the total energy produced per day.



CALCULATE MONTHLY PRUDUCTION:

	We calculated the monthly production by summing the daily production kWh values for each day in the DataFrame.
	For each month, all daily production values were added together to get the total energy produced in that month.
